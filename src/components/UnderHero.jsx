                As part of our development plan, we aim to expand into European
                markets, starting with countries such as Germany, Switzerland,

                sectors are experiencing steady growth, such as the Middle East,
                Southeast Asia, and North America. We strive to operate in
                locations with high tourism and investment potential,
                contributing to the coherence and dynamism of our brand and
                offering guests the exceptional experiences that define QDVI.
